#Egghead Talks: Sleeping Better at Night
Enhanced Transcripts for Tomasz ≈Åakomy egghead talk Sleeping Better at Night

##Description
Why are we afraid to deploy our app on Friday evening? Well, mostly because no one wants to debug production issues on Saturday and we really want to go home. Answering the (seemingly) basic question of "does our code actually work?" is surprisingly difficult at times.

In this talk I'd like to cover different approaches we, JavaScript developers, can embed into our toolkit to make our lives easier and our users happier (hint: unit tests are not enough).
